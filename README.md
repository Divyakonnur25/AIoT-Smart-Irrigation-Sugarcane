# AIoT-Smart-Irrigation-Sugarcane
An AIoT-based smart irrigation system for sugarcane farming that uses real-time soil moisture monitoring and automated pump control to optimize water usage and promote sustainable agriculture.
This project presents an AIoT-based smart irrigation system designed to optimize water usage in sugarcane farming. The system uses IoT sensors to monitor soil moisture and environmental conditions in real time and automatically controls irrigation based on crop requirements.

The goal is to reduce water wastage, improve crop productivity, and support sustainable farming practices.
